# Notoro 📝
**Notoro** is a minimalist task assignment app designed to keep things simple. No clutter. No unnecessary features. Just the essentials to help you stay organized.

## Features

- 📋 **Task Assignment:** Assign tasks with ease.
- 🎯 **Focused UI:** A clean, simple interface to help you focus on what matters.
- 🚀 **Lightweight:** No bloat, just the tools you need.

## Why Notoro?

Most task apps are cluttered with features you don't need, making them difficult to use. Notoro strips away the excess, giving you a streamlined experience.

NOTE: Currently All Tasks are not saved persistently but in memory only but I might add swiftData support and also it was mostly made in about 5-6hrs ,mainly to  learn about swiftUI,So project is not that organized.
